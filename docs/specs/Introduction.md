## Introduction

### Vision

The objective is seamless train travel in Europe and the current situation of real-time data exchange.

### Current Situation of Real-time Data Exchange

Information must be collected from multiple sources. The consumer of data must unify the data and piece together full train services before they can present the information to passengers. National Access Points are free in the format they use and an integrator functionality is not a required part of their platform. NAP’s can also be only the central location to direct consumers directly or indirectly to the actual sources of data.

### Methodology

This document follows the UML specification to define the solution. In this document, you will find:
- Actors
- Sequence diagrams
- Use Case diagrams
- Deployment diagrams

UML data models have been replaced by the graphical data description used for JSON data structures.
